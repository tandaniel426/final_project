                <h3>Quick Thoughts: Ford Explorer</h3>
                <img class="post-image" src="Images/IMG_6676.jpeg">
                <p>The Ford Explorer is one of the most popular crossovers on the market. In Michigan where I'm from, the latest generation Explorer is quite common to see. The 2020 redesign brought many significant changes such as the switch to a RWD platform and the new ST trim with 400 horsepower.  Just like the previous post about the Dodge Charger Hellcat, the picture above was taken by myself at the 2019 North American International Auto Show which was when the 2020 Explorer was revealed. The Explorer in the picture is a Platinum trim which can reach well over $60,000 when fully equipped. After looking at the prices online for top spec models, I just do not think that the ST or Platinum is worth the extra cost. With the addition of significant quality issues for a first-year model, I would suggest that potential customers should wait until the issues have been fixed in later model years to be safe.</p>

                <h3>Quick Thoughts: Dodge Charger Hellcat</h3>
                <img class="post-image" src="Images/IMG_6693.jpeg">
                <p>On this first post for quick thoughts, I will briefly discuss my thoughts regarding the 700+ horsepower Dodge Charger Hellcat. This picture was one that I personally took at the 2019 North American International Auto Show, so the vehicle was likely a 2019 model year. Since then, the Charger has new variants such as the Widebody and the Redeye. Even with the new variants and slight changes, the Charger has not really changed much since its most recent major refresh for the 2015 model year. Regardless, I like the overall idea of the high horsepower muscle car and I can say that the 6.2 L supercharged HEMI V8 is a legendary engine. If you are in the market for a four-door muscle car with insane horsepower numbers, look no further than the Charger Hellcat.</p>
