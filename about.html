            <p id="about">Hello, my name is Daniel Tan and I would like to thank you for visiting my personal automotive website. I am currently a fourth-year senior at Michigan State University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Information Technology. As an automotive enthusiast, there is nothing more relatable than being able to catch up on automotive content. Whether through videos or articles online, I always enjoyed watching and reading all about the newest vehicles on the market. I also understand that purchasing a new vehicle can be a tough decision for some people. My goal with this site is to provide a very minimalistic and simple website to allow users to quickly look through my personal posts regarding vehicles and automotive trends. I hope you find this website to be entertaining and/or helpful.</p>
