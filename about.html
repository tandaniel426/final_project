            <p id="about">Hello, my name is Daniel Tan and I would like to thank you for visiting my personal automotive website. I am currently a fourth-year senior at Michigan State University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Information Technology. As an automotive enthusiast, I really like to catch up on the latest automotive content. Whether through videos or articles, I always enjoyed seeing information about all of the newest vehicles on the market. I also understand that purchasing a new vehicle can be a tough decision for some people. My goal with this site is to provide a great experience that would allow users to quickly look through my personal posts regarding vehicles and automotive trends. Whether you are a fan of European luxury cars, American muscle cars, or everyday family SUVs and crossovers, I hope you find the content you enjoy the most.</p>
